# Sagiv's README

## Context

### Motivation

This document is my attempt to put down in writing everything that defines who I am, what I value, and what I expect when you work with me. The primary audience for this document is anyone who is on one of my teams, though everyone else is free to read and feedback on it.

I've been steadily evolving my approach to leadership over the past few years, and this document attempts to distill the important parts of that into something that's easy to consume.

Please treat this as a reference and a promise on how I will conduct myself as a lead, and a guide on what I expect from you. I urge you to hold me accountable to my promises and to call out anything that might be missing from this document. Your guidance can help me improve.

### My role

My role is to create diverse teams with the skills and the space to execute on big goals, and then keep them pointed in the right direction. I believe the very best products are built when there is a strong connection between engineering, product, and design.

I’m here to support you and I want to make sure you get the most out of working here with us.
I know I’m doing a good job if you’re happy, challenged, growing, know your goals and being effective at work.

My other responsibilities are:

-   Making sure the team is aligned to the business goals and working towards those as effectively as they can be.
    
-   Delivering value to the business using the team - that value is generally focussed around the customer, but could equally be driven around internal metrics too.
    
-   Making sure we're working on the right things at the right time.
    
-   Representing the team, and the business both internally and externally.

## Me

### Communication

I understand that different people have different preferences of communications. Having said that, here are my default ways:

-   In person - personal meetings are by far the best and preferred way for me to communicate. If we’re not at the same location, VC will be almost as good.
-   Voice call.
-   Chat - more casual issues. Remember - a good gif is worth a thousand words.
-   Emails - to avoid distractions I check emails only at specific intervals during the day so I might respond with a short delay. Please cc me in an email only when relevant. Please keep it as short as you can - if you can write the same msg with fewer paragraphs please do.
    
How to know when to use what? First, always default to 1:1 if you can wait, as I always prefer in-person conversations. If it’s urgent just ask to talk, call me or send SMS.

If it’s not urgent, ask yourself - how important it is. For me, it’s hard to ignore emails while it’s hard to follow chat threads so that usually dictates which platform of use. Edmund explains it even better [here](https://www.tomheon.com/2017/12/06/when-to-slack-me-when-to-email-me/).
    
### Good to know about me

-   I’m originally from Israel so while I speak Hebrew, Georgian, Arabic and Spanish - English is not my main language. I might slip sometimes, write an email with a spelling mistake, typo or grammatical error. Please don’t hesitate to correct me, I will appreciate it. When we communicate, things can get lost in translation. If you find something is not clear enough - please ask me to clarify.
    
-   [According to my wife] I have a grumpy look. I’m not grumpy it’s just my face and there’s not much I can do about it. You can be rest assured it has nothing to do with you or the company. If I’m working with you it means I like it and I’m happy otherwise I won't do it.
-   I cannot do or ask other people to do something I don’t believe in.
-   I’m a startup guy - I started 3 companies and I love the startup mindset. I like to move fast, think outside the box and keep iterating. “Ok” now is better than “perfect” never. I will not let red tape to slow us down.
    
-   I served as an officer in a special forces unit. I learned a lot from it and I hope to implement a few things I’ve learned there. I know the value of having a team of highly talented individuals working together. A good team can achieve amazing results and push the boundaries every single day.
    
-   When I look at a person I look at her/him as part of a team. Your contribution to the team is as important as any individual contribution. The team is here to support you and you are here to support the team. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
    
-   Family comes first. I believe that in order to be a good, productive employee you have to have a strong healthy base at home. I find keeping a good WLB critical for a good career. I will not expect you to be available on weekends or PTO unless it’s urgent.
    
-   I will repeat myself - especially around wider business context, 'why', and when we're going through any sort of learnings as a team. If even half of what I've said is any clearer for this, I think it's worth it.
    
### What I value

-   People - I spent a lot of my earlier career caring more about the software than the people, and it didn't serve me well. Our people (the team, and those of the wider organization) are the main reason we're successful, and I care massively about the happiness of the team. There’s a phrase in the Israeli army: “The human inside the tank will win”. It’s not about the tools but about the person who uses them.
-   Action - show, don’t tell.
-   Ownership and accountability - I take ownership and accountability for my work, and I value it in others. Owning a problem, a business area, or whatever it is you're doing, and making it your own removes my need to do so, and reduces the chances of me becoming a bottleneck in any communications.
-   Continuous improvement - I spend time trying to be the best I can - I've done it throughout my career from being a junior developer through to now. I expect you to do the same both on regular work and in your protected time, and much as I'll help and support you while you work on that improvement, I expect that improvement to be driven by you.
-   Push-based communications - I prefer you to push information to me rather than having to pull it. This will be seen to be working best if I never ask for a status update on a project, or ask for outcomes from a meeting/discussion.
-   Feedback - I care about doing a good job, and I care about those things that are important to my role above - if you feel I'm not delivering on those, or I could be doing so more effectively, I will genuinely appreciate and value any feedback you have for me.
-   Trust/autonomy - I will default to a trust/autonomy mindset for our working relationship. I'm happy to get more involved in checking things if you need me to, but I really like the 'leader/leader' mindset from '[turn the ship around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqmdLcyES_Q)'. Tell me what you intend to do, share, communicate, and I'll let you know if I have any concerns.
-   Collaboration - I love people who work together to achieve a better flow of work. This is true not only within the team but working with others outside of the team. Collaboration and sharing is a cornerstone to us build better relationships.
-   Perseverance - failure happens. That's absolutely ok. The best people will learn from that failure and move forward, and their attitude will rarely steer into the negative.

## You

### My expectations

Please reach out and tell me if anything, at all, feels off. It’s so much harder to solve problems when we’re guessing what they are. I’ll never consider proactively speaking up about challenges as a sign of complaining. I really value hearing your honest, transparent thoughts about how we can learn and grow together. You don’t have to have a solution for it but if you think you do - even better!

I know that I will make mistakes, and I'm going to make decisions that are wrong. I promise you that if you come to me and you explain why something is wrong, I will listen, and I will fix it.

-   I expect you to follow up on commitments you make. When you have to break a commitment, do so explicitly and let us know.
    
-   I expect us to make mistakes. I also expect us to learn from those mistakes by writing up what happened, sharing it and asking for help in interpreting it and making changes to avoid that same mistake in the future.
    
-   I expect you to be open with me. I know it’s hard to do it right away so I plan to build trust and get to know you first.
    
-   I expect you to think thoroughly about problems, and even come up with possible solutions, before you come to me so we can find the best solution together.
    
-   I expect you to push the team up. Spread around good energy, help your teammates and be a team player.

### Personal Development Reviews

These are managed away from the one to ones and are a way of you structuring your career progression. I will help you align what you wish to progress in with the overall business goals, though I will not drive these (in the same way I will not drive your career progression) - I'm here to mentor, support, and encourage, and ensure that the business adds it's formal support to your learning/development pathway.

### Where to focus on your first 90 days?

Your first 30 days are about learning your way around. Set up all the tools, get to the point where you can follow along with conversations and building a rapport with your teammates and stakeholders.

This will set you up to get to this by day 90:

-   You feel productive - you can take on small projects without a lot of guidance or repeatedly looking at reference materials.
    
-   You are helpful across organization - you can answer other people's questions about some questions and you know who to defer to for those you don't know the answer to.
    
-   You've built some level of trust with peers and vice versa, having established credibility with them through your strengths and theirs.
    
### Skip-Levels

I do skip-level 1:1 meetings with engineers on a revolving basis. The skip-level 1:1 is not to overstep the direct manager.

I usually ask for feedback and insights on how the team is doing. It’s critical to our success that we create an environment where anyone can feel safe to share feedback. We want everyone to grow, and often the best mechanism for that is being transparent and honest. The goal of these meetings is to give the engineers a time and place to do that. A secondary goal of these meetings is for you to get to know me, and vice versa. Or to get to know more about the business and our strategy.

### 1:1s

We can get a great deal of value from one to ones. It's very much is your meeting and your agenda.

I'll always have questions and comments, but we'll focus on what you want to talk about first, so please come to these meetings prepared.

I'll ensure I give you any wider context from the business, though this is secondary. Some key things I really care about during that time though. In particular, how you're doing and if there's anything you need from me.

These aren't our only opportunities to chat through, and if you need to catch up with me for anything else outside of these, please do so.

I’m happy to have you part of the team and I look forward to working with you,
*Sagiv*
