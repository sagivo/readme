# Sagiv's 1:1

Awesome, we have a 1:1 - a dedicated slot in our time to talk about anything you like 🎉  
It is **your time**.  Everything below is a suggestion only and you have full control over how you want this meeting to run. 

## Format
I find this format to work best at the beginning when we get to know each other. As we progress, from time to time, we can adjust it based on your feedback. This format is based on 30 minutes. If you need more time we can adjust. 
- [~5 min] **Let's get to know each other.** Choose any question to ask me from the list below. I will ask you the same question as well.
- [~20 min] **Your time**. We will talk about anything you like. Really, anything you like. We can talk about your career goals, the meaning of life or how come socks always disappear in the washing machine. 
-  [~5 min] - updates/requests from my side.
 
## Few Things

- This meeting is important. I will try my best not to cancel it. If you need to reschedule please let me know.
  
- This meeting is not for urgent things. please don't wait till our weekly 1:1 if you need something important.
  
- It's ok to talk about *anything* you like. don't feel obligated to talk only about work. we can always find time to talk about work outside of this 1:1.
  
- If you think you need more time or meet more often please do it! My calendar is yours, feel free to put a meeting anytime you like. If I don't have time let me know and I will make time.
  
- No laptops! yes, no laptops/phones/pagers/fax/telekinesis or any other distraction devices. Your time is valuable and it's important to have uninterrupted time with each other. Pen & paper can be a great alternative.
  
- I booked us a room but we can also take a walk, go outside or find a couch - up to you! If we're doing it over a VC, please make sure I can see you. It's important to have "face-to-face" time. 
  
I'm looking forward to getting to know you better each week, 

*Sagiv*
